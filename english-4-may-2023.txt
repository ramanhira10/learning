I have never been to Tom's house.

How far is it form here to his house.

His house is a long way from here.

Could you tell me how to get to Tom's house?

What do you think is the best way to get to Tom's house from here?

As for getting to his house from here, the best way is by taxi.

I think you should go by taxi.

How long does it take to get there by taxi?

I would prefer to go by taxi.

If that's the case, then I won't go with you.

I don't like travelling by taxi at all.

I would rather walk than go by taxi.

Before you go to visit him, you should make sure he's at home.

No one asked for your opinion.

There's no need to exaggerate.

Look, if you don't want to go, it's OK.

It makes no difference to me whether you come or not.

I'm going there whether you come or not.

I'm done with your habit of lying.

We'll talk about it sometime in leisure.

I was expecting a lot of people in my party, but only few turned up.

Keep it, it might come in useful.

I give you my profound thanks for saving my life.

I've got a car, too. But mine is not as good as yours.

Thank you once again for coming!

I hope we will meeti again soon.
