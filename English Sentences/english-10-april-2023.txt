I was studying when my friend called.

She was watching TV when the power went out.

He was driving to work when he got a flat tire.

They were hiking in the mountains when it started raining.

We were having dinner when the phone rang.

She was singing in the choir at church last Sunday.

He was practicing the pianon for hours last night.

They were waiting for the train when it was delayed.

We were playing cards when the storm hit.

She was working on a project when her computer crashed.
