I hope you've done what 

We have very little time a lot of work to do.

We'll have to work day and night with dedication.

We'll need to work tirelessly around the clock.

If we work with dedication, the work will finish quickly.

By working diligently, the work will be completed in no time.

If you want to move forward in life, sacrifices must be made.

If you want to succeed in life, you must be ready to make sacrifices.

Put aside your personal life for a short while and devote yourself fully to your job.

Not everyone gets the opportunity you have.

The opportunity you have is not available to everyone.

Make the most of this opportunity.

Consider yourself lucky that you were chosen for this job.

However, it's also necessary for you to be a bit careful.

But you also need to be a little cautious.

a little mistake can cost you dearly.

Even a minor mistake could end up being costly.

I'm being falsely accused!

I've nothing to do with your brother's murder.

What enmity does he have with you ?
