I hope you've done what 

We have very little time a lot of work to do.

We'll have to work day and night with dedication.

We'll need to work tirelessly around the clock.

If we work with dedication, the work will finish quickly.

By working diligently, the work will be completed in no time.

If you want to move forward in life, sacrifices must be made.

If you want to succeed in life, you must be ready to make sacrifices.

Put aside your personal life for a short while and devote yourself fully to your job.

Not everyone gets the opportunity you have.

The opportunity you have is not available to everyone.

Make the most of this opportunity.

Consider yourself lucky that you were chosen for this job.

However, it's also necessary for you to be a bit careful.

But you also need to be a little cautious.

a little mistake can cost you dearly.

Even a minor mistake could end up being costly.

I'm being falsely accused!

I've nothing to do with your brother's murder.

What enmity does he have with you ?

What took you so much time to arrive ?
Why did it take you so long to come ?
what caused the delay in your arrival ?
How come you took so long to come ?

You should have been here an hour ago.
You were supposed to be here an hour ago.
You were meant to be here an hour ago.

If I'm not wrong.
If I'm not mistaken, You came late on purpose.

You intentionally didn't come on time.
You deliberately didn't show up on time.

You're not needed here anymore.
You are no longer needed here.
You're no longer of any use here.

You didn't come when you were needed.
I wish you had arrived an hour earier.
I wish you had reached here one hour ago.

It would have been great if you had arrived an hour ago.
Although you're not needed here anymore, you can stay if you want to.
Even though you're not required here anymore. you're welcome to stay if you wish to.
