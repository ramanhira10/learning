---------- Story telling ----------

I was coming home from work when suddenly there was heavy rain. I didn't have an umberlla or any place to take shelter from the rain. It was raining heavily and my clothes had started getting wet, but I wasn't worried about them getting wet. I was worried about my phone. My phone was in my pocket which I had bought just a few days ago. I was afraid that if the rainwater reaches my phone, it will get damaged.

I stood in the rain and suddenly remembered that there was an ATM nearby where I could take shelter from the rain. I started running towards the ATM and reached a spot where there was no water from the rain. Some people were already standing there.

I immediately took out my phone from my pocket, which gotten wet due to the rain. I quickly wiped it with a cloth and as soon as I turned it on, it started working. I was happy that my phone wasn't damaged. I waited there for the rain to stop for about an hour. After the rain stopped, I haeded towards my home.
