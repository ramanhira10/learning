Yesterday after finishing work, I was on my way home. Usually, I take the bus to go home. But yesterday, I felt like walking and started walking towards my house. While passing a mall, I decided to take a stroll inside.

As I went inside the mall, my eyes fell on a shop where there was a lot crowd. I thought since I'm already here, why not eat something. I really like subway and there was a Subway there, So I went in, ordered a Subway, and sat on a table waiting for my Subway.

I was waiting for my Subway order at Subway when somebody called out my name from behind. It felt like a familiar voice, so I turned around and was surprised to see Sachin, my college friend. It was nice to see him after so many days. We had Subway together and started reminscing about college.

Though I had to go home, Sachin insisted that we go see a movie. I didn't want to hurt his feeling, so I agreed. It was nice spending some time with him.
