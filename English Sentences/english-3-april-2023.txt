Last night, it was 11'o clock, I was sitting on a chair reading a book. I had an exam the next day, so my plan was to study all night. While Studying, I got thirsty and went to drink water.

I opened the refrigerator, took out a bottle of water, and started drinking it. Then I heard a sound from downstairs. I got scared because there was no one else in the house except for me. My family had gone to a wedding in the village.

I wanted to see where the sound was coming from. Since I was alone in the house, I was also afraid. But I summoned up the courage to go down the stairs and checked to see that two cats were fighting. I started lauging and went back upstairs to continue my studies.
