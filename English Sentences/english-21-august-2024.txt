I will not let you go
I will not let you come
I will not let you eat this
I will not let you stay here
I will not let you play here
I will not let you study

It is getting cold
It is getting hot
It is getting dark
I am getting ready
we are getting late

I assure you that I will reach you on time
I assure you that I will teach you
I assure you that I will go
I assure you that I will teach you

Be grateful that I'm with you
Be grateful that everything is fine
Be grateful that she came
Be grateful that everything went well

I was calling you
She was talkint to you
He was playing outside
We were talking to each other
They were going to school
we were thinking

I am teaching you
She is studying
we are talking
You are lying
They are going to the school
Mom is cooking

What is there to cry
What is there to laugh
What is there to shout
What is there to go
What is there to be sad
What is there to be happy
