Hey, good luck for exams!

I hope you pass with flying colors.

I am sure you will pass with flying colors.

I too had a test yesterday and I passed my test with flying colors.

you worked very hard to get through this exam.

You will get through this flying colors.

Don't give up on yourself.

I am not giving up on myself.

I have full faith in myself.

I am confident that I will pass the exam.

I got my haircut yesterday.

Actually, I get a haircut every month.

I got my hair cut short.

I like short hair.

Besides, I look good with short hair.

Get you hair cut.

Your hair is too long.

Will I look good with short hair ?

Which hair-style suits me best.

I wil never have short hair. It doesn't suit me.

A little rest is all you need and if you don't get better by tomorrow, I think you should see a doctor.
