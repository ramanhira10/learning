"Yesterday, my friend threw a party and he insisted me that I attend as well. However, I couldn't go to this party because I had an exam and I needed to study. I tried to explain him that I couldn't come, but he wasn't willing to listen. When he insisted too much, I eventually said yes."

"I had said yes to going to the party, but now I was sitting and thinking whether I should go to the party or not. I knew if I go to the party, my whole day would be ruined and I had an exam in two days so I had to study. In the end, I decided not to go because my career is more important to me than our friendship."
