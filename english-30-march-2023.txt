Once upon a time, there was a man named Harry who was 30 years old and worked in a big company. Ever since he was a child, he had a dream of traveling the entire world, so he has been saving money for the past 10 years in order to achieve his dream.

After working hard for 10 years continuously, he finally had enough money to travel the world comfortably. Now, Harry was ready to travel the world, but he was a little nervous because he had to go on this journey alone. But in the end, he gathered courage and set out alone to explore the world.

As he traveled, he came across many challenges. He had to deal with unexpected weather and his luggage got lost at one point. But he didn't give up!

Every time he faced an obstacle, he thought through his options and came up with a plan.

Along the way, he met new friends who helped him out. They supported him when he needed it most, and he felt grateful for their kindness.

Finally, his trip went well. He found new things, made great memories, and became a better person.
