I worked all night, till 6 o'clock this morning.

I worked all night because I had an urgent deadline to meet.

I was so tired, I could hardly walk.

I was so tired, I couldn't walk.

Having finished my work, I left the office.

I left the office without even saying goodbye.

I was on my way to the bus station.

But unfortunately, I missed the bus.

I ended up walking home.

I walked all the way home alone.

I missed the bus, so I had to walk the way home.

When I got home, I was so tired I could barely stand up.

The lights were on, but no one was at home.

The light in the living room was on, but the light in the kitchen was off.

I looked around again to confirm that no one was home.

To my surprise, I found no one there.

I want to have a coffee.

The coffee machine had stopped working, so I went to the kitchen to make myself a cup of tea.

I was making tea and I ran out of milk.

I lit fire to keep off wild animals.

Keep this bucket, it will come in useful.

He snored all night and couldn't sleep.

They are rejoicing at my defeat.
