Yesterday my friend and I were going to watch a movie. We had both been wanting to see the new action movie that had just come out. We got to to threatre early to make sure we could get good seats.

This was a Hollywood movie, and we both love watching Hollywood movies and on top of that it was an action movie and even better than we expected. It turned out to be much better than we thought.

When we came out of theatre we felt hungry, and I noticed a restaurant nearby. We decided to check it out, but quickly realized the prices were too high for our budget.

As soon as we left the movie theatre, we got hungry and there happened to be a restaurant nearby. We thought of eating something, but as soon as we went to the restaurant, we found out that the food was very expensive and our budget wasn't enough to afford such expesive food.
