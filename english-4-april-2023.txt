About four to five days ago, I was getting late for college. I had to reach there urgently. My elder brother was getting ready to leave for work and he had his bike. I asked him if he could drop me to college on his way. He refused and said that he goes through a different route which doesn't pass by the college. I said then, can you drop me off at the metro station? From there, I can take the metro and reach college. He agreed to this and I sat behind him on the bike.

He dropped me off at the nearby metro station and left, telling me to be careful. I took out my phone from my pocket to check the time and realized it was already 10. With only 15 minutes left to reach college, I ran towards the station. However, upon reaching the entrance, I discovered that I had forgotten my metro card at home. I had no choice but to stand in line to buy a token. Finally, I got on the metro and arrived at college at 11:45. Despite my efforts, I still missed the first lecture, but at least I tried my best.
