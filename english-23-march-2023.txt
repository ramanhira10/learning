What kind of crazy talk are you doing ?

What nonsense are you talking about ?

I don't have time to listen to your nonsense.

I am tired of listening to your nonsense.

I think we should end this conversation here.

I am already under a lot of pressure.

I am already having a hard time and you are not letting me have a break.

It is my bad luck that brought me here.

I wish I hadn't come here, I regret coming here.

If I had known you were here, I never would have come.

Look, I am going really far and it might take me a lot of time to come back.

Just to let you know, I am traveling a long distance and there may be a delay in my arrival.

Listen, I am heading to a distant location and it could take me a long time to get back.

If you don't have time, get out of the car.

You seem to have come to the wrong place. Nobody lives here with that name.

But I was told he lives here.

Someone must have fooled you.

Does anyone else here besides you two ?

No there is no one else live here, except the two of us.

It would be better, if all you came here.
