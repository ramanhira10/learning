Once upon a time, there was a 20-year-old boy named John who lived in a small village. John't father was very lazy, never worked hard, and had a bad habit of gambling. He used to spend whatever he earned on gambling. Then, he would come home drunk and start fighting. John didn't like any of this, so he started hating his father. One day, he decided that he couldn't live with him anymore. Late one night when everyone was asleep, he got up, took his clothes, and left home. His plan was to go to a city far away from the village.

John's village was located near a railway station. When he went to the station, he didn't have enough money for a ticket. Despite being hungry, he decided not to go home and instead boarded a train that took him to a city far away. Since he didn't know anyone there, he started looking for work at nearby shops. A big store needed a boy and he began working there. John earned only nine thousand rupess per month, but he managed to save half of it by spending only half.

Now it has been four years since John came to the city for the first time, when he first came from the village, he had neither money nor any acquaintances. But, because of his good habits, he has made many friends and even earned significant amount of money.

Now, he wants to bring his mom and siblings to the city but first, he wants to buy a house. For that, he is working day and night. In the day, he works at a shop for eight hours and at night, he works in a factory for nine hours. He saves a good amount of money every month. John doesn't want to go back to his village again. He is happy with his life there.
